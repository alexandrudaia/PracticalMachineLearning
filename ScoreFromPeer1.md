peer 3 → Good job! you just forgot to use cross-validation to estimate the out of sample error
peer 4 → Very nice analysis. Well done. 
I particularly like the clustering and singular vector decomposition analysis you did. I also like the different algorithms that you used and reporting the in sample errors for those and based on that, coming to the conclusion that the boosting, bagging and random forest provides the best outcome. The only minor point is that you use multiple algorithms on your testing set as well which means that the testing set becomes part of the training set. 
you should decide on the algorithm based on the training set and apply it once to the testing set.
